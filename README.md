# 🌦️ Challenge - Weather App

Welcome to the **Weather App Challenge!**
This repository contains the implementation of a simple weather application that retrieves and displays weather information using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

We use predefined latitude and longitude coordinates from various cities to fetch and display detailed weather data, such as:

- 🌡️ Temperature
- 💧 Humidity
- 🌬️ Pressure (coming soon!)

`WEATHER_API_KEY= <your-api-key-here>`
- [ ] 📊 Fetch and display **pressure** data from the API
- [ ] 🔄 Implement data refresh on **Refresh** button click
- [ ] 🎨 Fix broken **weather icons**
- [ ] 🧹 Eliminate **duplicate data** issues
